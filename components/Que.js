                                    Of course, not all URLs are that messy. Nonetheless, many links
                                    are often wordy and lengthy for SEO reasons. Search Engine
                                    Optimization is all about better ranking in search engines,
                                    especially Google. One of the key factors that Google or any
                                    other search engine considers are the keywords in the URL. The
                                    URLs help describe the page content, and so it becomes a
                                    challenge for the user to shrink URL and use it. Lengthy links
                                    are difficult to share in the e-mails and social media platforms
                                    like Facebook and Twitter.

                                    As we all know, some social media sites such as Twitter have a
                                    character limit that doesn&rsquo;t allow users to post long
                                    URLs. Therefore, the post must be relevant and concise. Best

                                    Google URL shortener is handy when it comes to enhancing the
                                    aesthetic appeal of a URL. Short and precise URLs tend to look
                                    prettier when shared on social media. Not just limited to social
